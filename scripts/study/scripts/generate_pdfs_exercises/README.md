# Generate list of PDFs for exercises

This ditectory contains data and scrips needed to generate smaller PDFs containing only the pages of exercise from a Textbook in PDF format.

Basicaly we have a PDF name X.pdf (for example) and we want to select only the portions of it that have exercises.
All the pages are manually configured, and reside in `.csv` files.

I suggest you to look for `.csv` files and `.py` files in this directory to understand better.
